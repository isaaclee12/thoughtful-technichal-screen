    """
    Sort packages into stacks based on their dimensions and mass.

    Args:
        width (float): the width of the package
        height (float): the height of the package
        length (float): the length of the package

    NOTE: I've assumed that the measurements are floats
    Units are centimeters for the dimensions and kilogram for the mass.
