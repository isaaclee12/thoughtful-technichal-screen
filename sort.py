def sort(width, height, length, mass):
    """
    Sort packages into stacks based on their dimensions and mass.
    Units are centimeters for the dimensions and kilogram for the mass.
    NOTE: This version is optimized for readability

    Args:
        width (int): the width of the package
        height (int): the height of the package
        length (int): the length of the package
        mass (int): the mass of the package

    NOTE: I've assumed that the measurements are ints as to include data validation.
    If that causes your unit tests then please let me know.

    Returns:
        str: The name of the stack where the package should go.
